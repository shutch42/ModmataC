# ModmataC
A communications library in the C language for Modmata, a practical combination of the Firmata  and Modbus communication protocols!  
  
For use on the [Arduino Leonardo board](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/leonardo), running the [Modmata library](https://github.com/shutch42/modmata).  

If you wish to install from source, clone this repo and it's submodule, libmodbus. Then compile using `make`.  
  
Alternatively, you can install from one of [our releases](https://github.com/shutch42/ModmataC/releases/tag/v1). It is available as a tarball, or .deb package.  
  
If you want to quickly set up both the ModmataC library, and the default Arduino Modmata program, you can use our complete Modmata installer [located here](https://github.com/shutch42/Modmata-Complete-Install).
