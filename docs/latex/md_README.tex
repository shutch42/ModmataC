A communications library in the C language for Modmata, a practical combination of the Firmata and Modbus communication protocols! ~\newline


For use on the \href{https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/leonardo}{\texttt{ Arduino Leonardo board}}, running the \href{https://github.com/shutch42/modmata}{\texttt{ Modmata library}}. ~\newline


If you wish to install from source, clone this repo and it\textquotesingle{}s submodule, libmodbus. Then compile using {\ttfamily make}. ~\newline


Alternatively, you can install from \href{https://github.com/shutch42/ModmataC/releases/tag/v1}{\texttt{ our release}}. It is available as a tarball, and does not require updating submodules to install. However, you will need libtool for these installers to work.

If you want to quickly set up both the ModmataC library, and the default Arduino Modmata program, you can use our complete Modmata installer \href{https://github.com/shutch42/Modmata-Complete-Install}{\texttt{ located here}}. ~\newline
