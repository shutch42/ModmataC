ModmataC is a client-\/side communcications library for Modmata, a practical combination of the Modbus and Firmata communication protocols. This library can be used to write programs in C that communicate with the GPIO of a Arduino Leonardo. Modbus communication in this library is done using libmodbus.\hypertarget{index_Installation}{}\doxysection{Installation}\label{index_Installation}
ModmataC can be installed as a tarball from the release on our github page. Simply extract the tarball, and then run {\ttfamily sudo make install}. Just make sure that you have libtool installed first.\hypertarget{index_Usage}{}\doxysection{Usage}\label{index_Usage}
To use this library, include it in your C program with {\ttfamily \#include $<$\mbox{\hyperlink{ModmataC_8h}{Modmata\+C.\+h}}$>$}. To compile, use gcc with the -\/l flag\+: {\ttfamily gcc example.\+c -\/l\+ModmataC}.
